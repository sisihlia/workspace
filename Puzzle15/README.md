The code is tested on Puzzle 8. But the implementation can be done either for 8 tiles or 15 tiles.
The code returns fitness value and time duration from MainActivity.java

Current usage :
	Please select the approach from MainActivity.java.
	It will return the number of steps and the list of moves to be done to solve the puzzle if the puzzle is solvable

Enviroment :
 -Java 8
 -Android Studio 3.0.1
 -Emulator (Nexus_5_API_23:5554)
 -Ubuntu 16.04

Heuristic Search :
 -Manhattan
 -BFS
 -Mismatch

Because the code is still under development, there may be some bugs and affets the ouput.
You will errors such :

	Skipped 129 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.

Or unsynchronized output (but has number in it, so don't worry).

What you can do is to clean the project.
